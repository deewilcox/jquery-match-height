jQuery Code Snippet for Divs of Equal Height

This code snippet finds the height of two given divs and matches them so that they are equal height. The code snippet assumes that the sidebar column will typically be longer than the main_content column. It was also originally intended for use in a Wordpress application. However, it can be used with any set up.
